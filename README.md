# Advent of Code 2021

Please note that I did not optimize the solutions for readability. The code was left as it was when I found the solution

In this repository, dvanderleij is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using Kotlin language.

    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
